# Simple EDA
Simple Exploratory Data Analysis to understand nature of datasets

For those who don't know what is an EDA:

In statistics, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
